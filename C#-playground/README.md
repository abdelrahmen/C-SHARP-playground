#Console Pagination Project
This is a simple console application that allows the user to retrieve a page of data from a list of objects. The user can specify the page number and the number of objects they want to retrieve per page.

#Usage
When you run the application, you will be prompted to enter the page number and the number of objects per page. Here's an example prompt:

#results per page: 1
page Number: 10
In this example, the user is requesting the first page with 10 objects per page. The application will then retrieve the requested page from the list of objects and display it in the console.

####Output:
10         Sara            Wilson               $53,000.00
